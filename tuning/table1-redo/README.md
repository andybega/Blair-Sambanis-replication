Table 1 redo
============

Redo table 1 to compare different RF flavors: the B&S hyper-parameter settings, default settings, and tuned settings from `tuning-experiments`. The comparison metrics are average CV train AUC-ROC and test set AUC-ROC. 

Basically, although the tuned models outperform B&S in the train CV sets, they did not outperform on the test set AUC-ROC.
