Smoothing is not mentioned in the text. The replication R code is somewhat obtuse, but it seems that the ROC curves are generated by averaging true/false positive rate coordiantes over the 200 replications of 5-fold cross-validation, which is why they appear to be smooth. While not formally parametric, one could maybe consider this to be a sort of bootstrap smoothing. "
