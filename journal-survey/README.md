Journal survey
================

Survey journals to check use of ROC/AUC and specifically how common it
is to use smoothed ROC curves or AUCs derived from them.

“template.csv” is a template for adding a new journal issue (or other
group of articles).

The sample consists of:

1.  All references in the Blair and Sambanis paper, excluding books and
    non-academic articles.
2.  Two issues of JCR; 2020 volumes 1 and 9.

| The Promise and Pitfalls of Conflict Prediction: Evidence from Colombia and Indonesia | 2019 | NBER WP | There is no mention of smoothing, but the paper does not include ROC curves, only AUC and it’s not clear which variant they are from. Replication code is not available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Predicting Local Violence: Evidence from a Panel Survey in Liberia                    | 2017 | JPR     | Figures 1 looks like smoothed ROC, Figure 2 not. Smoothing is not mentioned in the text. The replication R code is somewhat obtuse, but it seems that the ROC curves are generated by averaging true/false positive rate coordiantes over the 200 replications of 5-fold cross-validation, which is why they appear to be smooth. While not formally parametric, one could maybe consider this to be a sort of bootstrap smoothing. |

Note that both articles include Blair as co-author.

## Data

  - “uses\_roc”, “uses\_smoothed\_roc”, “unclear\_roc”: Does the paper
    include figures showing (empirical / smoothed / unclear) ROC curves?
  - “uses\_auc”, “uses\_smoothed\_auc”, “unclear\_auc”: Does the paper
    include tables showing (empirical / smoothed / unclear) AUC-ROC
    values?

If the paper includes visually obvious empirical ROC curves, we assumed
that any corresponding AUC-ROC values were also generated from empirical
ROC curves.

Some papers had AUC values but no ROC curves. In these cases we
consulted replication code. These are listed below.
