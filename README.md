===============

## Folders

- `rep_original/`: the original replication code, with some trivial changes to be able to run it 
- `rep_nosmooth/`: our version of the replication; code restructured to allow running in parallel; corrects for the issues we bring up in the paper
- `table4/`: investigating how B&S Table 4 was created; and a fixed assessment
- `tuning/`: abortive tuning experiments that we did not include in the paper
