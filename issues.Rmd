### Introduction

While reading Blair and Sambanis (2020), a few issues stuck out. We downloaded the replication files authors provide from https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0022002720918923/suppl_file/sj-zip-1-jcr-10.1177_0022002720918923.zip. The original folder name of is `sj-zip-1-jcr-10.1177_0022002720918923/replication-3`. For simplicity, we extracted this `replication-3` folder and saved to the `Replication Files` folder of this repo.  

Before listing the primary issues we identified, we should note that we are partial to their approach. Theory is important. It is helpful for forecasting problems, especially with regards to identifying which variables to include in a model. This is particularly true when the goal is to assess how ... 


This document lists the primary issues we identified. 

- Improperly tuning of models
  - RM: In a twitter DM, I asked Blair to clarify -- "[I] was wondering how you all came to your tuning procedure for the RF model hyper-parameters?" He responded "mostly trial and error, honestly. ... Trial and error was on early data. Forecasts were for much later data"
- Using a regression framework in a classification problem
- Their train/test approach 
  - 5-year forecasts for sep plots and AUC scores)
- Rounding of AUC/ROC scores
- Lack of yearly test forecasts in favor of a single 5-year test forecast
- Table 4! 
  - There are only 20 onsets from 2001 to 2015 But there are 15 "Persistence" cases (top of table 4) and 16 "Change" cases (bottom of table 4)
- Treating the output of a RF regression model as Pr() -- (RM: I guess this is akin to a Linear Probability Model, but I'm not sure if this is possible in a RF framework
- The lack of procedures to account for rare events in an RF model

To-do

1. Full replication
    - Can we get their results
    - RM: maybe I can go through their code and bring it "up-to-date" i.e. make it tidy... 
    - Figure out how they built table 4 (It looks like this is done in STATA)
    - Check to see if it matter that they are using regression for a classification problem
2. Address tuning 
    - Does properly tuning the CAMEO model improve its performance?
3. Address AUC/ROC smoothing... 
    - How drastic is the change; does it change their conclusions? 
4. Run a yearly test forecast -- as is the current standard in TSCS forecasts (Is it the current standard?) 
5.
